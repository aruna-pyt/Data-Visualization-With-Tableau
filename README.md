## Information

I have planned to solve some Business Problems using Tableau and I am uploading all the solution regularly.

Each .tbwx file contains Data, Sheet, Dashboard and Story. In dashboard both Problems and Solution are provided(If you wish to see you may see). *All the visualizations are done using Sample Superstore Dataset.*

`For those who can not access any Tableau Flavor and want to see the magic of Tableau can use Public Server Link given below.`

## Problem 1

**Business Scenario :** Ray Hann, the sales supervisor of a retail industry, is expected to present a report to the senior sales managers for analyzing sales achieved by categories and segments on a yearly basis. He needs to develop a view for showcasing sales over categories and segments across
all the years. Using the view, answer the following questions:

1. Which segment has the highest sales across all years?

2. For which Year and Category was the Home Office sales greater than the Corporate
sales?

## Problem 2

**Business Scenario :** Rollin Ford, the regional manager of a retail chain, is in process of re-designing distribution and production strategies. He wants to look at profit for each state along with names of managers. He also wants to see the number of products returned by customers in each state.
Combine the data that is stored across different tables and create a visualization to satisfy the above requirement. In order to enhance the performance, create an extract for this data source. Rollin wants refresh to be happen incrementally based on date.
Using the view, answer the following questions: 

1. Which is the least profitable state?
2. Customers from which state have returned the highest number of products?

## Problem 3.1

**Business Scenario :** The general manager of an e-commerce company is planning to create a list of customers who have returned most of the orders they had placed. To take substantial
measures for upcoming orders, he needs to create a list visualization for customers who have returned more than half of their distinct orders in each region. Create a visualization and answer the following questions:

1. Which region has the highest number of products returned by the customers?
(Hint: Change the view to text)

2. How many customers do you have on your list?
